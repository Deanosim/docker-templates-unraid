# All my Docker Templates
- Not all of these are made by me, Most of them have been edited by me though

### Templates Created by Me
- Jellyfin.xml (I made this because the Offical one is missing from the jellyfin github)
- Spigot-BungeeCord.xml
- Antennas.xml
- Mellow-Discord.xml
- Nextcloud.xml
- Gotify.xml
- LanCache-Monolithic.xml
- zntcui.xml
- Phantombot.xml
- Statping-ng.xml
- [Steam-Prefill.xml](https://github.com/Deanosim/docker-templates-unraid/blob/master/templates/Steam-Prefill.xml) (Currently untested, but from what I can tell it should work)
- [Floatplane-Downloader](https://github.com/Deanosim/docker-templates-unraid/blob/master/templates/Floatplane-Downloader.xml)

### Templates Modified by Me
- (I don't use this anymore) NginxProxyManager.xml	(replaced the unraid app store verions docker repo url to the offical docker repo)
- Apt-Cacher-NG.xml (replaced the Unraid CA version with a more up to date docker image that doesn't get hash sum mismatch errors)
